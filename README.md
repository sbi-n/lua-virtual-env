# Lua VE
Lua VE (Lua Virtual Environment) is a tool designed to analyze obfuscated Lua code by hooking the functions called within the code to help understand its purpose and behavior. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing and removing server-side backdoors (commonly known as Server-Side Backdoors) or malicious scripts (Viruses) frequently found on the Roblox platform.
